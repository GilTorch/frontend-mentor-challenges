## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was very simple but while doing it I reflected 
on challenges I had while building something similar in a past project. I had an issue with the buttons not aligning because of
the paragraph being of different lengths for each column and I found that adding a height to the paragraph solves that.

### Continued development

In my future learnings, I'd like to focus on layouts.

### Useful resources

I didn't use a lot of resources for this except [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) when I want to be sure I am using a tag or a css property the right way.
